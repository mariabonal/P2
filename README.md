# Lab 2 SCAV 
#### Maria Bonal ✨

In this repository you can find the Lab 2 of the subject _Sistemes de codificació d'àudio i vídeo_.  

For running this lab we need the `BBB.mp4` video. In GitHub it could not weight more than 25MB so we cutted it to 50 seconds. 

We need to run the script `main.py` which will ask which exercise do you want to run and then run it. We already have the `output.mp4` file in case the user wants to run exercise 2, 3 or 4 before 1. If the user decides to start with exercise 1, the output can be overwritted. 

The other scripts are for exercises 2, 3 and 4. The script for exercise 2 is called `histogram.py`, the script for exercise 3 is called `resize.py` and the one for exercise 4 is called `change_audio.py`.
